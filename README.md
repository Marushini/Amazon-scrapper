Amazon Scraper Project Documentation

1. Introduction  
The Amazon Scraper is a Python-based project designed to extract product information such as names, prices, ratings, reviews, and availability from Amazon's website. It uses web scraping tools like BeautifulSoup, Selenium, and Requests to gather data efficiently.

2. Prerequisites  
Ensure the following libraries are installed before running the scraper:  
- `pandas`  
- `beautifulsoup4`  
- `selenium`  
- `requests`  
- `lxml`  

3. Features  
The scraper includes several key features:  
  Product Data Extraction: Captures product name, price, ratings, and reviews.  
  Pagination Handling: Navigates through multiple pages to scrape more products.  
  Filtering and Sorting: Allows filtering by categories or sorting by price or ratings.  
  Proxy Support: Uses proxies to avoid IP bans and improve scraping efficiency.  
  Price Tracking: Monitors price changes over time.  

4. Methodology  

4.1 Data Collection  
The scraper accesses Amazon product pages using Selenium for dynamic content loading and BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML content.

4.2 Data Parsing  
BeautifulSoup is used to extract relevant data elements, such as product titles, prices, and customer ratings. XPath or CSS selectors are employed for precision.

4.3 Data Storage  
Extracted data is stored in a structured format using Pandas DataFrames, allowing for easy manipulation and export to formats like CSV or Excel.

5. Challenges and Solutions  
  Dynamic Content: Selenium is used to load dynamic content before scraping.  
  IP Blocking: Implemented proxy rotation to avoid being blocked by Amazon.  
  Captcha Handling: Added detection mechanisms to pause and handle captchas manually.

6. Conclusion  
This project showcases how web scraping can be utilized to extract valuable information from e-commerce platforms. While it successfully gathers product data, further enhancements like automated captcha solving and optimized proxy usage can improve the scraper's robustness.
